# Response Quality Enhancer

This repository contains a condensed version of a prompt designed to enhance the quality of responses from Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Original Source

The original prompt is based on the "Response Quality Enhancer" found in the [Awesome_GPT_Super_Prompting](https://github.com/CyberAlbSecOP/Awesome_GPT_Super_Prompting/blob/main/My%20Super%20Prompts/Response%20Quality%20Enhacer.md) repository by CyberAlbSecOP.

## Condensed Version

The condensed version in this repository was created using an AI-assisted technique to minimize token usage while maintaining the prompt's effectiveness. This version is optimized for LLMs and may not be easily readable by humans.

You can find the condensed prompt in the [prompt.txt](prompt.txt) file in this repository.

## Technique Used

The condensation technique involved:
1. Using an LLM (Claude) to rewrite the original prompt with minimal tokens.
2. Iterative refinement through follow-up prompts.
3. Focusing on preserving the prompt's core functionality and intent.

## Usage

If you're unsure about what this condensed prompt does, you can ask any LLM the following:

```
Explain this prompt:
[Insert the condensed prompt text from prompt.txt here]
```

The LLM should be able to interpret and explain the prompt's purpose and functionality.

## Incorporating the Prompt

### For ChatGPT (Using Custom Instructions)

1. Log in to your ChatGPT account (requires ChatGPT Plus).
2. Go to Settings -> Personalization -> Custom Instructions.
3. In the "How would you like ChatGPT to respond?" section, add:
   "Please always consider the following quality criteria when responding: [Insert the content of prompt.txt here]"
4. Click "Save" at the bottom of the page.

Note: While Custom Instructions influence ChatGPT's responses, they may not be as powerful as modifying the core system prompt.

### For Claude

Currently, Claude does not have an option to set persistent custom instructions across all chats. To use this prompt with Claude:

1. Start a new conversation with Claude.
2. Begin your interaction by pasting the following:
   "For all responses in this conversation, please adhere to the following quality criteria: [Insert the content of prompt.txt here]"
3. Follow this with your actual query or request.

Remember to include this instruction at the start of each new conversation with Claude for consistent application of the quality criteria.

## Purpose

This condensed prompt aims to improve the quality of LLM responses by setting a high standard for relevance, practicality, specificity, personalization, and comprehensiveness.

## Contribution

Feel free to contribute to this project by suggesting improvements or reporting issues. Please ensure that any contributions maintain the spirit of the original prompt while optimizing for token efficiency.
