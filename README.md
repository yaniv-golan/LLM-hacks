# LLM-Hacks

## Overview

The **LLM-Hacks** repository contains a collection of prompts designed to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). These prompts aim to improve both the quality of the responses and the reasoning process behind them. They can be used independently or combined to maximize the effectiveness of the LLM's outputs.

## Contents

### 1. Response Quality Enhancer with CoT

- **Folder**: `Response Quality Enhancer with CoT`
- **Description**: This prompt focuses on the qualities of the final response, emphasizing what the answer should be like. It provides a checklist of criteria for self-evaluation, making it outcome-oriented and aiming for an ideal response based on specific attributes.

### 2. Response Development Enhancer with DoT

- **Folder**: `Response Development Enhancer with DoT`
- **Description**: This prompt focuses on the process of generating the response, detailing how to approach and construct the answer. It provides a step-by-step method for developing and refining ideas, making it process-oriented and guiding LLMs through a methodical approach to problem-solving.

## How to Use

The prompts can be used **separately** or **combined** depending on your needs:

### Using the Prompts Separately

- **Response Quality Enhancer with CoT**: Ideal when the focus is on enhancing the final output's quality, ensuring responses meet high standards of relevance, specificity, and user engagement.
- **Response Development Enhancer with DoT**: Best suited for guiding the LLM through a structured reasoning process, which is crucial for complex problem-solving tasks requiring deep analysis.

### Combining the Prompts

To maximize the effectiveness of the LLM, you can combine both prompts:

1. **Integration**: Merge the instructions from both `prompt.txt` files into a single prompt.
2. **Application**: This combined prompt will guide the LLM through a structured reasoning process while also ensuring the final response meets high-quality standards.
3. **Benefits**:
   - **Comprehensive Development**: Encourages thorough analysis and refinement of ideas.
   - **High-Quality Output**: Ensures the final response is user-centric, relevant, and engaging.
   - **Efficiency**: Streamlines the response generation process by embedding quality checks within the reasoning steps.
